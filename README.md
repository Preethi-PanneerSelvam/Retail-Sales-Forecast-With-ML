#Introduction
Retail sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions, optimize inventory, and plan for future growth. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sales data and make accurate predictions about future sales.

#Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install the required packages using:

#Installation
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:


#Data
The data directory contains the historical sales data in CSV format. Ensure that your data is structured with columns such as date, product ID, and sales quantity.

#Models
The project includes implementations of several machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Experiment with these models to find the one that performs best for your specific retail sales data.

#Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Adjust the hyperparameters and features to improve the model's accuracy.
