## Introduction

Retail sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions, optimize inventory, and plan for future growth. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sales data and make accurate predictions about future sales.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The `data` directory contains the historical sales data in CSV format. Ensure that your data is structured with columns such as date, product ID, and sales quantity.

## Models

The project includes implementations of several machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Experiment with these models to find the one that performs best for your specific retail sales data.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Adjust the hyperparameters and features to improve the model's accuracy.
